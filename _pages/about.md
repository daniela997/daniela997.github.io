Hi! I am currently a third-year Computing Science PhD student at the University of Glasgow. I am a part of the [Computer Vision and Autonomous Systems (CVAS)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/computervisionandautonomoussystems/) research group and the [Information, Data and Analysis (IDA)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/) Section. My research focuses on developing machine learning approaches for the restoration of images captured on analogue media. I am currently supervised by [Dr John Williamson](http://johnhw.com/) and [Dr Paul Henderson](http://www.pmh47.net/).  

Prior to my PhD, I completed an Undergraduate degree in Computing Science at the University of Glasgow with Honours of the First Class. During that time, I developed an interest in Machine Learning and its applications in the fields of Natural Language Processing, Image Processing and Computer Vision. My final year project, "A Deep Learning approach to artefact correction in photographic film" combined those interests with my passion for analogue film photography, and served as a foundation for my PhD research proposal. Apart from that, I worked in large-format printing for two years during the start of my degree, and as a Full-stack developer (Golang & JavaScript) during my Honours.
